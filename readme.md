### Competitive advantages

As long as I have diabetes I use diabetes diary to keep my health under control. As long as I have diabetes
I used to find some new technological ways to write that diaries because I found that diaries on the paper are just
not so useful and not accessible. You need to analyze a lot of data to understand whats really going on with the glucose
level and there is no guarantee that you didn't miss something vital if you use paper diary. Moreover, you need to
start a new diary every 6 month or may be year or you'll have a huge notebook which needs separate room and of course
absolutely not accessible. 

I analyzed some of same solutions but I clashed problems that I want to exclude. The first one is about accessibility
of the diaries. I mean, it's really easy to find diary for your phone or tablet, it's easy to find same thing for PC
or even web-based diary but what about all-in-one concept? Can I just get a diary which will be available on all of
my devices, online AND offline with synchronization. And what about sharing data to my doctor? To my family?
What if I want to set some notifications not to forget about something like making new glucose check? 
Ok. And the final bullet is interfaces. I'm not very strong in design but in all the apps I used before interfaces
are just awful. I want to make something your grandmother will understand. May be I will hide some advanced options
by default and will show it to you if you change your mode to "advanced".
